The following logic dicates what happens between the databases

Every lobby will have following entities:
Host: the player who created the lobby
Player: the people responding to prompts in the lobby
Session: the existing session which the players/hosts exist in
Prompt: the prompts that players respond to

Therefore, we need a session table containing:

SessionID (int) <- this is the unique ID generated when a session is created

We also need a Players table:
playerID(int) <- dynamically generated int for each player
playerName(varChar) <-
